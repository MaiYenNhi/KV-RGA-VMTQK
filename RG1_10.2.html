          <p>District 3 is located in the central part of Ho Chi Minh city.</p>
          <p>
            District 3 combines French colonial architecture with modern-day
            urban development. It's home to iconic landmarks like the War
            Remnants Museum, Jade Emperor Pagoda, and Tan Dinh Church, and some
            top schools like Nguyen Thi Minh Khai High School or Marie Curie
            High school, which attract both tourists and locals alike. So we
            call it a home of ancient buildings.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, many French colonial-era structures that are eye-grabbing
            and fascinating live here. You can see them in ancient villas on
            Tran Quoc Thao, Ba Huyen Thanh Quan, and Tu Xuong Street.
          </p>
          <p>
            Besides, some buildings resemble the styles of Japan, and China. For
            instance, a miniature Japanese town in Le Thanh Tong street, Jade
            Emperor Pagoda in Mai Thi Luu street.

      <p class="locallife1-content">Unlike the tourist-heavy District 1, District 3 feels more like a place
        where people live their everyday lives. You will hear the sounds of street
         vendors calling out their wares, smell the aroma of grilled meat and fresh
          herbs from local kitchens, but also still see the dynamic range of shops,
           centers and traditional buildings.

        <p>What makes District 3 truly special is its community atmosphere.
           Despite being so close to the city center, it retains a distinctly
            local vibe.
        </p>
        <p> In the mornings, you will see people on motorbikes heading
          to work, vendors setting up their food stalls, and children in 
          uniforms heading to school. 
        </p>
        <p>The afternoons are often quieter, with
          locals taking a break from the midday heat but still the district 
          is vibrant through trucks and big vehicles still working under the 
          afternoon sun. 
        </p>
        <p>In the evening, the district comes alive again, as 
          families gather for dinner at open-air eateries, and young people
          meet up at cafes or karaoke bars.
